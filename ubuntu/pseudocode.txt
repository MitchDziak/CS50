Prompt the user for height

Print the height with one blank space for every height after 1

Print one line for each height. If the height is 2, it prints blank lines -1 plus a #.

Print empty_space * x - 1 plus a #

Start out by making a grid first based on height. If 4, itd be 4 # tall and 4 # wide

Then try it with blank spaces, but replace one blank space at the end with a # for each line up to the height (do while loop)

get int height
do

i = row, i++ for each row
print empty spaces for int height - 1 + (# + i)




while row less than int height
